# Vehicle Management System

## Overview
The **Vehicle Management System** is a Java-based application that uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage different types of vehicles. The system includes a `Vehicle` class as the base class, with `Car` and `ElectricCar` classes inheriting from it. Each class has unique attributes and methods specific to its type, enabling efficient vehicle management and detailed information display.

## Features
- **Vehicle Class**: The base class that defines general attributes such as `name`, `capacity`, and `terrainType`, establishing a foundation for all vehicle types.
- **Car Class**: Inherits from `Vehicle` and includes additional properties like `topSpeed`, with methods to classify the car as "Fast" or "Slow" based on speed.
- **ElectricCar Class**: Extends `Car`, adding specific attributes like `batteryKwh` and a class-level attribute to track the cumulative battery capacity of all electric vehicles created.
- **Enums**: Utilizes an enum, `TerrainType`, to define constants for different terrains (`LAND`, `AIR`, `SEA`, `AMPHIBIOUS`), making the code more organized and readable.

## Project Duration
This test took approximately **1 hr and 30 minutes** to complete, covering the phases of design, coding, testing, and documentation.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout this test, I achieved:
- A strong understanding of OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in Java.
- Hands-on experience with enums to improve code organization and readability.
- Practice in overriding methods to implement specific behaviors for subclasses.
- Improved skills in writing clear documentation to make code more maintainable and understandable.

Additionally, I am pleased to share that I achieved **100% on the test** for this test, using the code presented here.

## Conclusion
This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of Java and OOP concepts while allowing me to build a functional and organized application.
